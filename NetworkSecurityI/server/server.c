 Project Description:
 Write a network application program using Socket API to implement a simple end-to-end encryption and decryption application. Suppose Alice wants to send a confidential file to Bob over an open network. Using this program, the file will first be encrypted using the AES-128 encryption algorithm by the client program, and the encrypted document (in binary) will then be transmitted to Bob. The server program in Bob's machine will read the program, and the encrypted docuemnt (in binary) will then be transmitted to Bob. The server program in Bob's machine will read the encrypted file, decrypt the file, and then stroe that file in a fixed directory in Bob's machine.

// coefficients are used: 0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x09, 0x0b, 0x0d, 0x0e, but multiplication by
// 1 is negligible leaving only 6 coefficients. Each column of the table is devoted to one
